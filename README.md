# COMP 590/790 Deep Learning Assignments

Assignments from UNC 590/790 Deep Learning course taught by Prof. Colin Raffel. 

This class provides a practical introduction to deep learning, including theoretical motivations and how to implement it in practice. At the begining of this course we covered multilayer perceptrons, backpropagation, stochastic gradient descent, and many other basic models and techniques in Deep Learning. Moreover, we introduced convolutional networks for image processing, starting from the simple LeNet to more recent architectures such as ResNet for highly accurate models. Then, we discussed sequence models and recurrent networks, such as LSTMs, GRU, and the attention mechanism.
